I'm a passionate software developer focused on backend development, skilled in Java EE, Python, and frameworks like Flask and Spring Boot. I thrive in building efficient, scalable server-side applications and crafting seamless integrations.

Though my primary focus is backend, I also enjoy working with front-end technologies. With React.js, I bring intuitive and dynamic user experiences to life, ensuring a smooth journey from backend to frontend.

🌐 Technical Stack:

Backend: Java EE, Python, Flask, Spring Boot, Laravel
Frontend: React.js
Tools & Databases: [mysql, postgres, sqlite.]
Let’s build something great together! ✨
